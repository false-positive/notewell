### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Typewriter. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). If you'd like, you can use [this template](#template-for-submitting-bug-reports) to structure the information.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [FAQs on the forum](TO-DO: Addline)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3ATypewriter)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.


#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After going through [the necessary first steps](#before-submitting-a-bug-report), you can create an issue on and provide the following information.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Typewriter, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Typewriter otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, **record the GIF with the [Keybinding Resolver](https://github.com/atom/keybinding-resolver) shown**. You can use [this tool](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If you're reporting a crash**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. Include the crash report in the issue in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem is related to performance**, include a [CPU profile capture and a screenshot](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#diagnose-performance-problems-with-the-dev-tools-cpu-profiler) with your report.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Typewriter) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Typewriter?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? (TO-DO: Add links to older versions of Typewriter)
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of Typewriter are you using?** (TO-DO: Add how to figure out the exact version of Typewriter)
* **Are you running Typewriter in a virtual machine?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?

### Your First Code Contribution

    Unsure where to begin contributing to Typewriter? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

    * [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
    * [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

    Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

    If you want to read about using Typewriter, you can have a quick look through these resources in the Wiki.

## Attribution

As a young open source organization we continue to learn a lot along the way. Writing this Contributors Guidelines was one such learning experience, where we learnt so much from the [Contributors Guidelines](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) of one of our favorite open source projects, [Atom](https://atom.io).
